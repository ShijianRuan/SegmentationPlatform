# 1. Introduction


For a general introduction about Mimics, please refer to Mimics Reference guide under **Help** -> **Manual**.


Mimics supports Python scripting. For many of the available Mimics features, a Python API is now included in Mimics. You can write your own Python scripts, using those Mimics features that are available via scripting. This allows you to automate your workflows. Mimics comes with a pre-installed Python interpreter and includes a script editor and a scripting console.


---

# 2. Python installation


To be able to use scripting in Mimics, **Python 3.5** needs to be installed. Mimics comes with support for installing Python 3.5.2. Extra packages and libraries such as NumPy or SciPy can be used too but are not preinstalled. The user can install them manually.


Please follow the steps below to get access to Mimics scripting.


## 2.1. Installing Python 3.5


If Python 3.5 is not already installed in your system, the recommended installation method is to use the Mimics installation wizard. Python installation will be done automatically as part of the Mimics installation.


If you already have Python 3.5 installed, then you can choose the Python interpreter of your preference in Mimics, such as Anaconda or others, but make sure to use Python version 3.5.


## 2.2. Configuring Mimics for scripting


In the menu **File** -> **Preferences** -> **Scripting** make sure that the path to the Python intepreter is set correctly. If you installed Python using the Mimics installation wizard, then the path should be set correctly automatically. If you installed Python separately, then you can manually set the path to the local directory that contains the Python installation.


The default Scripting library path is set by default in `\..\MedData\Scripts`. In that location you can find all the tutorial scripts that are included in the installer. You can set the path to the scripting directory of your preference. Any scripts present in the specified folder are automatically registered in the menu **Script** -> **Scripting Library**.


![Mimics Script Preferences](images/preferences.png)


## 2.3. Installing extra packages (optional)


If desired, install additional Python packages or libraries such as NumPy or SciPy. If you already have installed a Python 3.5 version that contains the external Python libraries of your preference, please follow the instructions above to set as default this Python interpreter.


If you only have available the Mimics built-in Python installation, then it is recommended to install a full version of Python 3.5 in order to use external libraries. You can find a full version of Python 3.5 in the following location: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) . To install external Python packages you can use the **pip** library, which is the recommended tool from Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) for installing Python packages. If you install a full version of Python 3.5, the pip library is included in the installation folder.


Below you can find a simple example of how to install NumPy and PyQt. First, launch the Windows command line (**cmd**) and use the **cd** command to change the directory to the one that contains the **pip.exe** file. This is located in a subfolder of the Python 3.5 installation location. Then type the following:


```bash
pip install numpy
pip install PyQt5

```


NumPy and PyQt5 are now normally installed to your system. For more information please visit the following page: [https://packaging.python.org/installing/](https://packaging.python.org/installing/) .

# 3. Mimics IDE


Mimics IDE is the environment that provides comprehensive facilites to Mimics users to develop scripts. Mimics IDE consists of an **Editor**, a **Console** and a **Scripting Library**.


## 3.1. Editor


Mimics comes with a built-in editor. The editor can be accessed via the Mimics menu: **Script** -> **Toggle Editor**. The editor will open in a separate window.


![Mimics Script Editor](images/editor.png)


In the editor you can create a new project via the ![new](images/new.png) button. To save a project click the ![save](images/save.png) or ![saveas](images/saveas.png) button. To open an existing project click the ![open](images/open.png) button.
In the left panel of the editor window, the user can view all the scripts present in the selected folder. Clicking on a script will open it in the editor. To run the script, click the ![run](images/run.png) button or press F5 or CTRL-R. To access the help page of the Mimics API click to the ![help](images/help.png) button.


## 3.2. Python console


An alternative method for executing Python commands is via the built-in Python console in Mimics. You can show or hide the console via the Mimics menu: **Script** -> **Toggle Console**.


![Mimics Script Editor](images/console.png)


## 3.3. Scripting Library


A third way method for executing Python scripts is via the Mimics menu **Script** -> **Scripting Library**.


As explained earlier, you can specify a path to a particular script directory via **File** -> **Preferences** -> **Scripting** in Mimics. Any scripts present in the specified folder will automatically be registered under the Scripting Library. It is then possible to execute such scripts with a single click. This is the ideal method for users who need to execute a script without needing to see or modify the script. (You need to restart Mimics for the changes to become effective.)


## 3.4. External IDE


Mimics is compatible with with external Integrated Development Environments (IDE). You can run your script from an external IDE. For more information see the section External IDE of the scripting guide.


---

# 4. Scripting in Mimics Quick Start Guide


## 4.1. Show/hide Editor and Console


To show or hide the Mimics Editor or Console, click on the menu **Script** and select **Toggle Editor** or **Toggle Console**.


![toggle_editor_console.png](images/toggle_editor_console.png)


## 4.2. Run a script


There are several ways to run a script.


A first method is via the Mimics Editor. Click on the menu **Script** and **Toggle Editor**. In the window of the editor, click on the button ![open](images/open.png) to browse to your script. After selecting the script, it will appear in the Editor window. Click on the button ![run](images/run.png) (or press F5 or CTRL-R) to execute it.


A second method is via the **Run Script** button in the **Script** menu. This allows you to select your script and run it.


![run_script_from_script.png](images/run_script_from_script.png)


A third method to run a script is via **Scripting Library**. Please note that you need to configure your scripting preferences in order to make scripts visible in the **Scripting Library** menu. For details see Section 2.2 of the Introduction. Once you have configured your preferences, scripts will appear in the **Scripting Library** and you can run the scripts with a single click.


![run_from_scripting_lib.png](images/run_from_scripting_lib.png)


## 4.3. Execute Mimics and scripts from Windows Command Prompt (CMD)


You can run Mimics and scripts from the Windows Command Prompt (cmd). You can find the available options in the cmd by typing **-h** or **-help** as a parameter in cmd (see below). The options and examples are shown in Mimics Medical 20.0 but they apply in Research as well by replacing the word Medical with Research.


```bash
cd "C:\Program Files\Materialise\Mimics Medical 21.0"

MimicsMedical.exe - h

MimicsMedical.exe - help

```


The available options and their description are shown below:


```bash
MimicsMedical.exe [-help] [-background_mode] [-kill] [-save_log <filename.txt>] [-run_script <script_name.py [args]>]

-h, -help                Display this help
-b, -background_mode     Runs the application without GUI (in the background). Quits the application after task completion
-k, -kill                Quits the application after task completion
-save_log <filename.txt> Saves all logger messages to a file specified
-r, -run_script          Runs a python script.
script_name.py           Name of the python script to run
[args]                   Optional parameters to pass into the python script.  They can be accessed using sys.argv[n]

```


**Example:**


In folder `\..\MedData\Scripts` there is a copy of the tutorials. To run the import_dicom.py file from Windows command prompt, type the following (it is assumed that Mimics is installed in C: drive for this example.):


```bash
cd "C:\Program Files\Materialise\Mimics Medical 21.0"

MimicsMedical.exe -b -run_script "C:\MedData\Scripts\import_dicom.py"

```


**Note:** It is recommended to include the full path in ” ”.


## 4.4. Clean variables and workspace


In general, a namespace uniquely identifies a set of names so that there is no ambiguity when objects having different origins but identical names are combined. In essence, a namespace in Python is a mapping of every name you have defined to corresponding objects. Different namespaces can co-exist at a given time but are completely isolated. A namespace containing all the built-in names is created when you start the Python interpreter and exists as long you don’t exit.


The Mimics Editor and Mimics console have a shared namespace. Consequently, when you execute a script from the Editor which creates certain Python variables, these variables will be accessible from the Mimics Console too, and vice versa. This allows for easy experimentation and debugging while writing scripts. Scripts that run via Run Script use the same shared namespace with Console and Editor. In contrast, scripts that are executed from the Scripting Library are executed in each run in their own namespace, which is not shared with other namespaces like Editor and Console. This is to allow for clean execution of your scripts.


There are several ways to clean the namespaces if desired. You can clean the namespace shared between Editor and Console by clicking on the **Script** menu and **Clear All** (see image below).


![clear_all_script.png](images/clear_all_script.png)


Another way to clean the namespace of Editor and Console is to right-click on the Console in Mimics and select **Clear All** as shown below.


![clear_all_console.png](images/clear_all_console.png)


Alternatively, you can clean the namespaces implicitly prior to running scripts from any execution source. This option applies only for the namespace created by the run from Editor, Console or Run script. This setting is accessible from the menu **Edit** in **Preferences** (see image below).


![clear_all_prefs.png](images/clear_all_prefs.png)


## 4.5. Getting started with the Mimics API


Python interaction with Mimics is done via the Mimics Application Programming Interface (API). Via this API, it is possible to call many of the regular Mimics features (segmentation, measurements, etc), access the objects in a Mimics project, etc. A complete overview of the API can be found in the “Mimics API” section. Below we explain the basic concept by means of a simple example.


The required module is called **mimics**. This module comes as part of the Mimics installation, and is imported automatically when using Mimics (so there is no need to import it explicitly when executing a Python script within Mimics). Accessing the Mimics API is done via this module, as illustrated below.


![api.png](images/api.png)


## 4.6. Using the Mimics API


Like many programming languages, Python supports Object Oriented Programming. This is the basis of the Mimics API as well: each object is an instance of a class. Dot notation is used as the way to say to an instance to use one of the functions or properties of the class it belongs to. For instance, the method *create_mask* can be called to create a new object of type *mimics.Mask* as follows.


![useapi.png](images/useapi.png)


The Mimics API is organized into submodules, reflecting the structure of the regular Mimics menus. For instance, there are submodules *mimics.file*, *mimics.segment*, *mimics.analyze*, etc. In addition, the Mimics API includes several other useful modules and classes as listed in the “Mimics API” section.


You can use *Ctrl* + *Space* to get autocomplete. Note that autocomplete works for names of methods, arguments, variables, etc. To confirm the selection of the module (i.e: mimics.segment), functionality (i.e: mimics.segment.threshold()) or argument ((i.e: mimics.segment.threshold(mask=))) you can use *Tab* or *Enter*.


## 4.7. Working with Hounsfield and Grayvalues pixel units


In the regular Mimics UI you can choose to work with Hounsfield units or gray values. You can modify the setting in the **Preferences** in the **File** menu (in the tab **General**). The Mimics API, however, works **only** with gray values (i.e., all API methods that work with thresholds etc assume that the unit is gray values), regardless of your preference setting. If you need to work with Hounsfield units, there are two Mimics APIs that will assist you: HU2GV converts from Hounsfield Units (HU) to Gray Values (GV), and GV2HU does vice versa. Below is an example.


```python
# Values in HU
low_hu = 240
high_hu = 3071

# Convert values to GV
low_gv = mimics.segment.HU2GV(low_hu)
high_gv = mimics.segment.HU2GV(high_hu)

# Use the tool with the converted values
mimics.segment.threshold(mask=m,threshold_min=low_gv,threshold_max=high_gv)

```


## 4.8. Access to Mimics objects


A frequently used class is *mimics.data*, which allows you to access most of the types of Mimics objects that are present in the Mimics project management tab (masks, parts, measurements, planes, points, reslice views, etc).


Below are some examples on how to access parts and masks in the project *Heart.mcs* that is included in the installation of Mimics (MedData folder). This project contains three masks with names LA, LV and Aorta, and the respective parts.


To access the first mask of the project:


```python
# First mask of the project
mask1 = mimics.data.masks[0]
print(mask1.name)

```


To access the mask with name LA:


```python
# Mask LA
mask1 = mimics.data.masks.find("LA")
print(mask1.name)

```


In the above example there is only one matching mask (one mask with the name “LA”). When there are multiple matching results, *find* will return only one result, but the Mimics API also has a similar method *filter* that returns all matches. Note that *find* and *filter* also support regular expressions.


To assign the part with name Aorta to a variable:


```python
# Find part Aorta
mask1 = mimics.data.parts.find("Aorta")
print(mask1)

```


To delete the mask LV:


```python
# Delete LV mask
lv = mimics.data.masks.find("LV")
mimics.data.masks.delete(lv)

```


To duplicate all the masks and parts:


```python
# Duplicate all the masks and parts of the opened project
for m in mimics.data.masks:
       mimics.data.masks.duplicate(m)

for p in mimics.data.parts:
       mimics.data.parts.duplicate(p)

```


To explore which Mimics objects are accessible with Mimics API you can type *mimics.data.* in the Editor or Console. Autocomplete will show the full list of types of objects that are availabe in the data container.


## 4.9. Access to the properties of Mimics objects


Most of the Mimics objects can be accessed with scripting and are reprented as a class in Mimics API. In Python attribute reference is the most common understood action. Consequently to refer to the properties of a Mimics object you can simply refer to the attributes of the instance of the class that the Mimics object is assigned to. See the examples below:


```python
# The first mask that is included in the mask container is assigned to variable m
m = mimics.data.masks[0]

# To access the attributes of this instance of mimics.segment.Mask class use the dot notation.
# That way you can access properties of the Mimics mask that is assigned to variable m. See below:
print(m.average_value)
c = m.color
n = m.number_of_pixels
b = m.get_voxel_buffer()

# To get a list of the valid attributes(built-in and special) for that object, type the following:
print(dir(m))

```


## 4.10. Activate Mimics tools with Python


Using the Mimics API you can not only perform most of the operations in Mimics via API calls but you can also launch or ‘activate’ some of the regular Mimics tools with their regular graphical user interface. For example, thresholding is an operation that can be performed in the following two ways. The first is to perform thresholding as part of a script without interaction with the user. All the parameters required are defined in the script:


```python
# Thresholding without user interaction
m = mimics.data.masks[0]
l_t = 100
h_t = 3000
mimics.segment.threshold(mask=m,threshold_min=l_t, threshold_max=h_t)

```


The second way is by activating the thresholding tool. You can interactively choose the low and the high threshold that will be applied to the chosen mask (see the image below). The script will continue after you confirm your choice.


```python
# Thresholding with user interaction
m = mimics.data.masks[0]
mimics.segment.activate_thresholding(mask=m)

```


![activate_tool.png](images/activate_tool.png)


**Note:** Currently, only a limited number of selected tools have such an ‘activate’ API.


## 4.11. Display and suppress dialog boxes


In the previous section it was briefly explained that there are some tools that can be activated with scripting and require interaction with the user. Using the Mimics API you can additionaly create your own dialog boxes or even suppress those that automatically appear in Mimics (e.g. change orientation of DICOM images). Below you can find an example on how to suppress some of the built in dialog boxes of Mimics with predefined answers.


```python
# Set predefined answers to suppress some of the built in dialog boxes
mimics.dialogs.set_predefined_answer("CannotConvertProject", "Yes")
mimics.dialogs.set_predefined_answer("ProjectHasNotValidCS", "Yes")
mimics.dialogs.set_predefined_answer("ChangeOrientation", "default")
mimics.dialogs.set_predefined_answer("FixImagesPositioning", "Yes")
mimics.dialogs.set_predefined_answer("SaveChangedProject", "No")


# Code that imports DICOM images
# ...
# ...

```


In the Mimics API there is the possibility to create your own dialog boxes that can give you customised interaction with the script. Below you can find an example on how to create a dialog box with some predefined list of possible answers.


```python
# Create customised dialog boxes with scripting
# ...
# Code that performs an operation
# ...
sel = mimics.dialogs.question_box(message="Please indicate the region to continue", buttons="LA;LV;Aorta", title= "Region Selection")
# ...

```

We recommend to not use this API to modify DICOM tags with value representation OB, tags with group ID 0002, and tags with tag ID 0000. Caution should be taken when modifying tags with value representation SQ, to not create internal inconsistencies.


| Parameters: | - **filename** (*str*) – Full path to the file
- **tagpath** (*typing.Iterable*) – Tag to anonymize
- **value** (*str*) – New value |

| Exceptions: | ValueError |
| Example: |  |


```python
#It is highly recommended to copy the original DICOM before modifying it
f = r'C:\MedData\DemoFiles\DICOM_Heart\C_36052635_0000.dcm'

patient_name_tag = [(0x0010, 0x0010)] # hexadecimal

- **save_as_type** (*str*) – (optional) Allows to save the project in different types:
* Mimics Project Files :: Saves the project in the DICOM patient coordinate system. Starting from Mimics 18.0, the internal file format has been changed to facilitate creation of projects from large datasets. There is no longer a file size limitation as opposed to the 4GB limitation in previous versions of Mimics. Projects created in Mimics 18.0 and later will be saved in the new format and can contain multiple image sets.
* Mimics 14.0-15.0 Project File :: Mimics 14-15 Project File Save the project according to the old DICOM patient coordinate system. The images will be shifted with half a slice increment.
* Mimics 16.0-20.0 Project File :: Saves the project in the DICOM patient coordinate system. In case the Mimics file contains more than one image sets at the time of saving in this file format, only the currently active image set and the objects linked to it will be saved.
- **save_image_compression_as_jpeg** (*str*) –

(optional) When saving a project, it is possible to compress the images in the project with a lossy JPEG compression. This way the size of the project is reduced.


**It is possible to choose between three quality presets:**

- High Quality - Low Compression.
- Medium Quality - Medium compression.
- Low Quality - High compression.


The higher the compression factor is, the smaller the files become, but the worse the image quality in the result.
- **serialization_backend** (*str*) – (optional) Allows to save the project in different serialization backends:
* zip ::  .zip format that was used for serialization of previous (<18.0) versions of Mimics. Has techical 4GB file size limitation.
* sql_lite :: Modern database format without 4GB file size limitation of previous versions of Mimics. It is not possible to open such projects in old versions of Mimics. |

***class*`mimics.image.``BinomialBlurFilter`**

Bases: `mimics.image.Filter`


Blurring filters are traditionally used to remove noise from images, by attenuating high spatial frequencies. The Binomial blur filter computes a nearest neighbor average along each dimension.


**`number_of_iterations`**

| Type: | <class ‘int’> |
| --- | --- |


***class*`mimics.image.``CurvatureFlowFilter`**

Bases: `mimics.image.Filter`


The Curvature flow filter performs an edge-preserving smoothing on the images. The iso-contours of the images are viewed as level sets, where the pixels with a particular gray value form one level set. The diffusion speed is proportional to the curvature of the contours. Therefore, areas of high curvature will diffuse faster than areas with low curvature. Hence, small jagged noise artifacts disappear quickly, while large scale artifacts evolve slowly, thereby preserving sharp boundaries between objects.


**`number_of_iterations`**

| Type: | <class ‘int’> |
| --- | --- |


**`time_step`**

| Type: | <class ‘float’> |
| --- | --- |


***class*`mimics.image.``DiscreteGaussianFilter`**

Bases: `object`


The Discrete Gaussian filter computes the convolution of the image with a Gaussian kernel for calculating the transformation to apply to each voxel. This filter is used typically to smooth and reduce the image detail, preserving the edges for low variances..


**`gaussian_variance`**

| Type: | <class ‘float’> |
| --- | --- |


**`max_kernel_width`**

| Type: | <class ‘int’> |
| --- | --- |


***class*`mimics.image.``Filter`**

Bases: `object`


Filter is a general object for the image filters.


***class*`mimics.image.``GradientMagnitudeFilter`**

Bases: `mimics.image.Filter`


The magnitude of the image gradient is extensively used in image analysis, mainly to help in the determination of object contours and the separation of homogenous regions. The gradient magnitude filter computes the magnitude of the image gradient at each pixel location. This filter does not apply any smoothing to the image before computing the gradients. The results can, therefore, be sensitive to noise.


***class*`mimics.image.``MeanFilter`**

Bases: `mimics.image.Filter`


The mean filter is commonly used for simple image noise reduction. Each output pixel is computed by finding the statistical mean of the gray-level values surrounding the corresponding input pixel. Note that this filter is sensitive to the presence of outliers in the neighborhood and does not preserve the image edges.


**`radius`**

| Type: | <class ‘int’> |
| --- | --- |


***class*`mimics.image.``MedianFilter`**

Bases: `mimics.image.Filter`


The median filter is particularly useful to reduce speckle noise and salt and pepper noise. Its edge-preserve nature makes it useful in cases where edge blurring is undesirable. This filter computes the value of each output pixel as the statistical median of the neighborhood of values around the corresponding input pixel.


**`radius`**

| Type: | <class ‘int’> |
| --- | --- |


**`mimics.image.``apply_filters`(*filters*)**

f2 = mimics.image.MedianFilter()
mimics.image.apply_filters([f1,f2])

```


**`mimics.image.``hide_filtered_images`()**

Turns off filtered images visualization.

**`mimics.segment.``segment_airway`(*point_1*, *point_2*, *noise_filter=False*, *leakage_detection=2*, *post_processing=True*)**

Segments semi-automatically the airway track on inspiration or expiration scans. By indicating the start of the trachea the user initiates the airway segmentation process. The outputs of the tool are a mask and 3D model of the segmented airway.


During the segmentation process it is important to investigate the segmentation for leakages. Leakages occur in regions where the contrast between the airway and the airway wall decreases, in such regions the segmentation can leak into the pulmonary parenchyma and subsequently lung tissue gets erroneously marked as airway.


The segmentation process will preview the segmentation result in 2D and 3D. Leakages can be removed by placing a leakage indicator on the 3D preview or afterwards by post-processing the mask using edit mask tools.


The Segment Airways tool allows semi-automatically segmentation of the airway by indicating the trachea.


| Parameters: | - **point_1** (*typing.Tuple**[**typing.SupportsFloat**,**typing.SupportsFloat**,**typing.SupportsFloat**]*) – Origin point of the trachea.
- **point_2** (*typing.Tuple**[**typing.SupportsFloat**,**typing.SupportsFloat**,**typing.SupportsFloat**]*) – Point that indicates the direction of the trachea.
- **noise_filter** (*bool*) – (optional) It is used if the operation fails to start or many branches are missing. If true, the noise filter is on.
- **leakage_detection** (*int*) –

(optional) Leakages occur in regions where the contrast between the airway and the airway wall decreases, in such regions the segmentation can leak into the pulmonary parenchyma and subsequently lung tissue gets erroneously marked as airway.


Weak detection (0 value) will result in most branches found, the result will contain most leakages. Strong detections (4 value) will result in a shorter airway and less leakages.
- **post_processing** (*bool*) – (optional) If true, it performs post-operation processing to the Part to improve the quality of the triangles while it maintains the essential characteristics of the airway. |

# API Change Log


Records of notable changes including new APIs, removed APIs and list of modified APIs (compared with Mimics 20) can be found in  `Mimics Change Log`.


---

# 1. Introduction


Mimics is compatible with external Integrated Development Environments (IDE). This new functionality allows users to write, run and debug scripts through external IDEs like PyCharm, Eclipse and Visual Studio.


External IDEs facilitates users to:


- Manage complex scripts with multiple files
- Edit and refactor code
- Manage the package and the environment


---

# 4. Using an External IDE


Users are now able to run and debug scripts via an External IDE with the proper configurations described below:
It is accessible via Script menu-> Toggle Script Listener.


![Toggle_listener.png](images/Toggle_listener.png)


Once activated a logger message will appear “Mimics script listener is active” as seen below. This indicates that the previously configured connection to the external IDE is active and scripts can be run and debugged.


![mimics_script_listener_on.png](images/mimics_script_listener_on.png)


Once the work with the external IDE is complete you can then toggle the listener off which will close the connection between the IDE and Mimics. This will produce a logger message shown in the log panel “Mimics script listener is stopped”.


![mimics_script_listener_off.png](images/mimics_script_listener_off.png)


---

# 3. Get autocomplete in external IDEs


To get autocomplete functionality similar to the one of Mimics console and editor to external editors you can follow the steps below depending on the Python interpreter that you use to script.


**Step 1**:
A .whl file is included in the installer of Mimics. This file is located in the installation directory: `\..\..\Materialise\Mimics Medical 21.0\Help\API`. Locate the file and copy the full path to it.


**Step 2**:
Run the Windows Command Line (CMD) as Administrator


-If you are using the Python 3.5.2 interpreter that is included in the installer of Mimics to script in your external editors, you can follow the next steps:


**Step 3**:
Change the directory to the location of the preinstalled Mimics interpreter e.g: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\Materialise\Python\3.5.2`. To change your directory:


```bash
cd "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Materialise\Python\3.5.2"

```


**Step 4**:
To install the contents of the . whl file, execute the following command in the cmd session that is open:


```bash
python -m pip install <full path to the .whl file that is copied in Step 1>

```


-If you are using a complete installation of Python 3.5 (separately installed) as an interpreter in your external editor, see the instructions in Section 2.3 of this scripting guide. To get and install the contents of the .whl file you have to type the following in your Windows Command Line (CMD):


**Step 3**:


```bash
pip install <full path to the .whl file that is copied in Step 1>

```


**Note:** It is recommended to include the full path in ” ”.


The autocomplete functionality is now available in your external editor. Make sure that you use the correct interpreter in your external editor to get Mimics autocomplete.


**Known issues**


- Materialise does not guarantee the correct functionality of the API functions that are used as context managers. An example of a context manager is the `mimics.disabled_gui_update()`. Context managers allow you to allocate and release resources precisely when you want to. The most widely used example of context managers is the `with()` statement. While using Mimics with an External IDE you can use the equivalent code instead.


```python
try:
  # commands

except:

  # commands

finally:

  # commands

```


- Materialise does not guarantee the correct functionality of the returned type memoryview. For details about the functions that return the memoryview type see the documentation of Mimics API (e.g: method `get_voxel_buffer()` of the class `mimics.segment.Mask()`)


---

# 2. Installation guide for RPyC


To establish communication between Mimics and an external IDE the first step is to install the **RPyC** Python package.
If you choose to work with the built in Python interpreter, the package is already included in the installer and consequently the setup is ready.
In case you want to use a compatible Python interpreter of your preference then the RPyC package needs to be installed separately for this interpreter. For instructions on how to install an external Python package see the section 2.3 of the introduction section of this guide.


Once the package is installed successfully, you will need to configure your external IDE settings to work. In the following sections you can find  an examples of how to connect to a commonly used external IDE for script development. This however does NOT indicate any official support or endorsement in regards to it’s compatibility with Mimics.

# 1. Automatic import of DICOM images


Using the Mimics API, the user can automate the import of DICOM images. As input, we assume there is a directory containing DICOM images (this could be a single study, or multiple studies). By using `mimics.file.import_dicom_images()` with the default parameters, the DICOM files are imported.


```python
input_dir=r"C:\MedData\DemoFiles\DICOM_Airway"
mimics.dialogs.set_predefined_answer("ChangeOrientation", "default")
mimics.file.import_dicom_images(source_folder=input_dir)

```


By default, upon opening the project Mimics will display a dialog box asking for confirmation of the orientation of the images. If desired, this dialog can be suppressed by setting a predefined answer for it.


The last step is to anonymize the active image set in Mimics. Use `mimics.file.anonymize_project()` to anonymize the project.


```python
mimics.file.anonymize_active_image()

```


---

# 2. Semi-automatic import of standard images


The user can automate the import of Bitmap or JPEG images. As input, we assume there is a directory containing all images.
The scan resolution in x, y, and z dimensions is required as input to ensure correct dimensions of the volumes and 3D objects. This information is typically provided by the radiologist who performed the scan. Use `mimics.file.import_standard_images()` with the parameters mentioned above.


```python
      input_dir=r"C:\MedData\DemoFiles\BMP_Leg"
mimics.dialogs.set_predefined_answer(mimics.dialogs.dialog_id.CHANGE_ORIENTATION, "RAB")
mimics.file.import_standard_images(source_folder=input_dir,xy_resolution=1,z_resolution=1,patient_name="MimMat")

```


By default, Mimics will display a dialog box asking for confirmation of the orientation of the images. If desired, this dialog can be suppressed by setting a predefined answer for it. For instance, we could select the orientation RAB as mentioned above. By default the `mimics.file.import_standard_images()` will open Mimics and show the images. Note that the Mimics project is not saved.

# 3. Skull segmentation


In this tutorial some basic segmentation features of Mimics are presented using the project Mimi.mcs, as available in `C:\MedData\DemoFiles`. The first step is to open the project using `mimics.file.open_project()`. All the previously open projects will be closed.


```python
      # Open the project
      input_dir = r'C:\MedData\DemoFiles\Mimi.mcs'
mimics.file.open_project(input_dir)

```


To perform thresholding, an empty mask is created first using `mimics.segment.create_mask()` and is renamed to *Bone*.


```python
# Create an empty mask
mask_a = mimics.segment.create_mask()
mask_a.name = "Bone"

```


The next step is to perform Thresholding with `mimics.segment.thresholding()` and save the result in the mask *Bone* that is previously created. The minimum and the maximum threshold values need to be supplied as input. Note that the Mimics Python API currently always uses gray values (not Hounsfield units).


```python
# Perform thresholding with selected min and max values
mimics.segment.threshold(mask=mask_a,threshold_min=1250,threshold_max=2800) # thresholds are set in gray values

```


The next step is to perform Region Growing. First a new point is created on the anatomical part that will be the input for the Region Growing operation. In the below example, a new mask is created and the original mask is preserved. The new mask is renamed to *Segmented Skull*. Next, the point is deleted since it was needed only for the Region Growing operation. In case you don’t have a license for the Analyze module, a mimics.Point object cannot be created. In this case it is recommended to use `mimics.segment.activate_region_grow()` instead of the `mimics.segment.region_grow()` API.


```python
# Create a point that will be used fot the region growing operation
point_1 = mimics.analyze.indicate_point(title="Region growing point",message= "Please indicate a point on the part of interest")
point_2 = point_1.coordinates
point_2 = tuple(point_2)
# Region growing. The original mask is preserved
mask_b = mimics.segment.region_grow(point=point_2,input_mask=mask_a,target_mask=None,slice_type="Axial",keep_original_mask=True)
mask_b.name = "Segmented skull"

```


Calculation of the 3D part and exporting it as STL is the following step. Using `mimics.segment.calculate_part()` and  `mimics.file.export_stl()` the part is calculated with the given quality and afterwards exported as an STL. The name and location where it will be saved should be specified.


```python
#Calculation of the 3D part
part_a = mimics.segment.calculate_part(mask=mimics.data.masks.find("Segmented skull"),quality="High")
# Export the STL
mimics.file.export_part(object_to_convert=part_a,file_name=r"C:\MedData\skull_of_Mimi.stl")

```


The final step for this tutorial is to save the project and exit Mimics


```python
# Save the project and exit
mimics.file.save_project()
mimics.file.exit()

```

# 4. Femur segmentation


In this tutorial basic operations to the lower limb are illustrated. The right femur and the pelvis are segmented and basic operations are performed to the masks and the 3D parts.


First, the project Hip.mcs is opened from `C:\MedData\DemoFiles` and thresholding is performed. (More basic explanation on segmentation functionality can be found in the tutorial on Skull segmentation.).


```python
# Open the project
mimics.file.open_project(r'C:\MedData\DemoFiles\Hip.mcs')
 # Create an empty mask
mask_a = mimics.segment.create_mask()
mask_a.name = "Lower limb"
# Perform thresholding with selected min and max values
mimics.segment.threshold(mask=mask_a,threshold_min=1250,threshold_max=2650) # thresholds are set in gray values

```


To fill holes in the active mask, use `mimics.segment.fill_holes()`.


```python
#Fill holes in the segmentation mask
mimics.segment.fill_holes(mask_a)

```


The next step is to perform Region Growing and segment the right femur. (Basic explanation on Region Growing can be found in the tutorial on Skull segmentation.)


```python
# Create a point that will be used fot the region growing operation
point_1 = mimics.analyze.indicate_point(title="Region growing point",message= "Please indicate a point on the part of interest")
# Region growing. The original mask is preserved
mask_b = mimics.segment.region_grow(point=point_1,input_mask=mask_a,target_mask=None,slice_type="Axial",keep_original_mask=True)
#mimics.data.points.delete(point_1)
mask_b.name = "Segmented right femur"

```


The segmented right femur mask is renamed to *Segmented right femur*. In case pelvis and left femur need to be obtained in a separate mask, the Boolean Operation *Minus* can be performed. A new mask is created and is then renamed to *Pelvis and left femur*.


```python
# Perform the boolean operation ""Minus"" to take the anatomy of interest".
mask_c = mimics.segment.boolean_operations(mask_a=mimics.data.masks.find("Lower limb"), mask_b=mimics.data.masks.find("Segmented right femur"), operation="Minus")
mask_c.name ="Pelvis and left femur"

```


The final step is to smooth the parts, export them to STL files, save the project and exit Mimics. For the smoothing operation, a smoothing factor of 0.6 is selected and the original parts are preserved.


```python
#Calculation of the 3D parts
part_a = mimics.segment.calculate_part(mask=mimics.data.masks.find("Segmented right femur"),quality="High")
part_b = mimics.segment.calculate_part(mask=mimics.data.masks.find("Pelvis and left femur"),quality="High")
# Smooth 3D parts
objects = mimics.data.parts
for part in objects:
    part.visible = False
    smoothed_part = mimics.tools.smooth(object_to_smooth=part,smooth_factor=0.6,keep_originals=True)
    smoothed_part.visible = True
    # Export the STL
    mimics.file.export_part(object_to_convert=smoothed_part,file_name="C:\MedData\\" + smoothed_part.name + ".stl")
# Save the project and exit
mimics.file.save_project()
mimics.file.exit()

```


---

# 5. Landmarks and measurements in the shoulder


In this tutorial some basic segmentation, landmarking and measurements operations are illustrated on the project Shoulder.mcs from `C:\MedData\DemoFiles`. The first step is to open the project and perform thresholding, region growing  and calculation of the 3D part. (More explanation on those steps can be found in the tutorials on Skull segmentation and Femur segmentation.)


```python
# Open the project
mimics.file.open_project(r'C:\MedData\DemoFiles\Shoulder.mcs')
 # Create an empty mask
mask_a = mimics.segment.create_mask()
# Perform thresholding with selected min and max values
mimics.segment.threshold(mask=mask_a,threshold_min=1250,threshold_max=2800) # thresholds are set in gray values
mask_a.name = "Shoulder"
# Create a point that will be used fot the region growing operation
point_1 = mimics.analyze.indicate_point(title="Region growing point",message= "Please indicate a point on the part of interest")
# Region growing. The original mask is preserved
mask_b = mimics.segment.region_grow(point=point_1,input_mask=mask_a,target_mask=None,slice_type="Axial",keep_original_mask=True)
mimics.data.points.delete(point_1)
mask_b.name = "Segmented shoulder"
#Calculation of the 3D part
part = mimics.segment.calculate_part(mask=mimics.data.masks.find("Segmented shoulder"),quality="High")

```


The next step is to indicate the landmarks in the area of interest on the shoulder. Two points are selected on the scapula and one point on the humerus. Using  `mimics.analyze.indicate_point()` the user can indicate the points in the place of interest. In this tutorial the points on the scapula are indicated first and the point on the humerus follows.


```python
# Set the anatomical landmarks of the shoulder
anatomical_landmarks = ["Acromion","Coracoid process","Humerus"]
for point in anatomical_landmarks:
    p = mimics.analyze.indicate_point(title=point,message= "Please indicate a point on the {}".format(point))
    p.name = point

```


The following step is to calculate the distance between the points on the scapula and the point on the humerus. For each distance to be measured, the points in the data container are found, the measurement is created using `mimics.measure.create_distance()` and is renamed.


```python
# Create distance measurement between coracoid & acromion and humerus
m = mimics.measure.create_distance_measurement(point1=mimics.data.points.find("Acromion").coordinates,point2=mimics.data.points.find("Humerus").coordinates)
m.name = "Acromion-Humerus"
m = mimics.measure.create_distance_measurement(point1=mimics.data.points.find("Coracoid process").coordinates,point2=mimics.data.points.find("Humerus").coordinates)
m.name = "Coracoid process-Humerus"

```


Finally, the angle defined by those 3 landmarks (with the point on the Humerus as centerpoint of the angle) is calculated using `mimics.measure.create_angle()`. The final step is to save the project and exit Mimics.


```python
# Create Angle measurement between  the three landmarks in the shoulder area
mimics.measure.create_angle_measurement(point1=mimics.data.points.find("Acromion").coordinates,point2=mimics.data.points.find("Humerus").coordinates,point3=mimics.data.points.find("Coracoid process").coordinates)
# Save the project and exit
mimics.file.save_project()
mimics.file.exit()

```

# 6. Preparation for fluoroscopy


Using the Mimics API you can control a set of functionalities that are contained in the view module of Mimics. This tutorial shows how to control the visibility of different objects in the project, how to activate/deactivate the 3D Mask preview in the 3D viewport, and how to prepare your project for fluoroscopy simulation.


For this tutorial the Mimics project Heart.mcs from `C:\MedData\DemoFiles` will be used. As a first a step, the project is opened in Mimics.


```python
# Open Heart.mcs project
input_dir=r'C:\MedData\DemoFiles\Heart.mcs'
mimics.file.open_project(input_dir)

```


The project by default contains masks and 3D parts for the following anatomies: LA, LV and Aorta. The following piece the code shows the hidden masks and selects all the masks.


```python
# Show and select the masks
for m in mimics.data.masks:
    if not m.visible:
        m.visible = True
    m.selected = True

```


The parts that are already present are deleted in the following step. Immediately afterwards the Mask 3D Preview is activated and you can inspect the result of the segmentation.


```python
# Delete the parts
for p in mimics.data.parts:
    mimics.data.parts.delete(p)

# Activate 3D preview
mimics.view.enable_mask_3d_preview()
mimics.dialogs.question_box(message="Please inspect the heart segmentation",buttons='OK')

```


The following step calculates parts for each of the segmentation masks. All the changes after the manual editing of the masks will be applied in the parts. All the parts are calculated with Optimal quality and they are set to visible. Additionally the Mask 3D Preview is disabled.


```python
# Create 3D parts
for m in mimics.data.masks:
    p = mimics.segment.calculate_part(mask=m, quality='Optimal')
      p.name = m.name
    p.visible = True

# Step: Disable 3D preview
mimics.view.disable_mask_3d_preview()

```


The following step is the preparation for fluoroscopy simulation. The objects that will be visualised in simulation are prepared with custom contrast. A fluoroscopy view is also created.


```python
# Preparation for fluoroscopy
visualised_objects = []
contrast = 0.7
for p in mimics.data.parts:
    visualised_objects.append((p,contrast))
# Activate fluoroscopy
f = mimics.view.create_fluoroscopy_view_default()

```


The final step is to activate the fluoroscopy simulation and apply all the setting that are defined in the preparation step above. For the simulation, High quality is selected.


```python
# Activate simulation
sim_quality = "High"
f.simulate(objects_contrast=visualised_objects, quality=sim_quality)

```

# 7. CT Heart landmarking and segmentation


Note: To run the following tutorial the NumPy library should be installed. To install external Python libraries, see the Section 2.3 of the Introduction.


For this tutorial the Mimics project Heart.mcs from `C:\MedData\DemoFiles` will be used.


The tutorial shows how to prepare for applying the CT heart segmentation tool. A series of function calls is created and controls the script. One function is created for each operation that will be performed. The main operations are thresholding, landmarking, calculation of CT heart segmentation masks and calculation of 3D parts. Appropriate naming is used for the respective functions.


```python
# Main part of code that controls the script
# Open Heart.mcs project
input_dir = r'C:\MedData\DemoFiles\Heart.mcs'
mimics.file.open_project(input_dir)
# Function for the thresholding
activate_thresholding()
for l in LANDMARKS:
      # Function for the landmarking
      indicate_landmark(LANDMARKS.index(l))
# Function for the ct heart
calc_ct_heart()
#Function for the creation of the 3d parts
create_3d_parts()

```


On the top of the script the required libraries must be imported and the required constants must be declared.


```python
      # Import the numpy library that is useful for some operations
try:
    import numpy as np
except ImportError as ie:
    print("================================================================")
    print("=== The 3rd party Python package 'numpy' is not installed! ===")
    print("=== To install it, use 'pip install numpy' in your cmd!    ===")
    print("================================================================")
    raise
      # Define a shortcut
      md = mimics.data
      # Constants declaration
      MASK = "Threshold"
      LANDMARKS = ("RA", "RA",
                   "LA", "LA",
                   "LV", "LV",
                   "RV", "RV",
                   "Aorta", "Aorta",
                   "Pulmonary Artery", "Pulmonary Artery",
                   )
      SEED_RADIUS = dict(RA=10.0,
                         LA=10.0,
                         LV=10.0,
                         RV=10.0,
                         Aorta=8.0,
                         Pulmonary=8.0,
                        )

      SEED_COLOR = dict(RA=(0, 255, 255),
                        LA=(255, 0, 255),
                        LV=(255, 205, 205),
                        RV=(145, 112, 255),
                        Aorta=(255, 0, 0),
                        Pulmonary=(0, 0, 255),
                        )

      MASKS = ("RA", "LA", "LV", "RV", "Aorta", "Pulmonary Artery")

```


The first function that is called after opening the Heart.mcs project is activate_thresholding(). This launches the thresholding tool where you can select the desired thresholds and modify the crop box. Furthermore the newly created mask is renamed.


```python
def activate_thresholding():
    m = mimics.segment.activate_thresholding()
    m.name  = MASK
    return

```


After the thresholding, there is a *for* loop that calls the function indicate_landmark() for each landmark, as they are declared in the constants. During each call of this function, the user clicks and select the position of the landmark. The indicator of the intersection lines navigates to the location of the selected coordinates and finally a sphere is selected in that position. The name, the radius and the color of each sphere is defined and controlled by the constants that are defined in the top of the script.  See the indicate_landmark() function below.


```python
def indicate_landmark(pid: int):
    pdef = LANDMARKS[pid]
    name = pdef
    try:
        coords = mimics.indicate_coordinate(message="Indicate {} ".format(pdef),confirm=False, show_message_box=True)
    except InterruptedError:
        return False

    mimics.view.navigate_to(coords)
    pnt = mimics.analyze.create_sphere_center_radius(coords, SEED_RADIUS[pdef.split()[0]])
    pnt.name = pdef
    pnt.color = tuple(np.array(SEED_COLOR[pdef.split()[0]]) / 255)
    return

```


The following function that is called is the calc_ct_heart() that performs the segmentation of the different anatomical parts of the heart. After the segmentation masks are created, the colors of the spheres are assigned to the masks respectively. For the calc_ct_heart() function see the code below.


```python
def calc_ct_heart():
    thres = md.masks.find(MASK)
    seeds = []
    for p in md.spheres:
       if p.name in LANDMARKS:
           seeds.append(p)
    mimics.segment.calculate_ct_heart_from_mask(thres, seed_points=seeds)
    for p in md.masks:
       if p.name in MASKS:
                 p.color = tuple(np.array(SEED_COLOR[p.name.split()[0]])/255)
    return

```


The last function that is called is the create_3d_parts(). This function creates parts from the masks that are the result of the segmentation and assigns the correct name to them.


```python
def create_3d_parts():
      for p in md.masks:
            if p.name in LANDMARKS:
                  par = mimics.segment.calculate_part(p,"Medium")
                  par.name = p.name
      return

```


To summarize, the sequence of the functions that is presented performs the required actions to segment the anatomy from a CT heart dataset. Masks and 3D parts with correct naming and color are created as output.

# 8. Access to Part Triangles and Points


Note: To run the following tutorial the NumPy library should be installed. To install external Python libraries, see the Section 2.3 of the Introduction.


The Mimics API also supports low-level data access to images, masks and 3D parts (or STLs). This tutorial shows how to access the nodes (points) and triangles of a part. The Mimics project Heart.mcs from `C:\MedData\DemoFiles` will be used. As a first a  step, the project will be loaded in Mimics.


```python
      # Import the required libraries
try:
    import numpy as np  # First need to install numpy package for Python. Type pip install numpy in your cmd
except ImportError as ie:
    print("================================================================")
    print("=== The 3rd party Python package 'numpy' is not installed! ===")
    print("=== To install it, use 'pip install numpy' in your cmd!    ===")
    print("================================================================")
    raise
      # Open Heart.mcs project
      input_dir=r'C:\MedData\DemoFiles\Heart.mcs'
      mimics.file.open_project(input_dir)

```


Next, get the relevant part.


```python
# Get the LV part
p = mimics.data.parts.find("LV")

```


To access the nodes and triangles of this part and read them as NumPy arrays, see the code below.


```python
if p is not None:
# Get a copy of nodes and triangles
        nodes,triangles = p.get_triangles()
# Read them with numpy
        nodes = np.asarray(nodes)
        print(len(nodes))
        triangles = np.asarray(triangles)

```


Next we try to find the node that has the biggest distance from the origin of the World Coordinate System (WCS).


```python
# Find the node that is the furthest from the WCS origin
        mx = []
        for m in nodes:
                mx.append(np.linalg.norm(m))
        i_mx = mx.index(max(mx))

```


In the following step the closest node to the WCS is calculated.


```python
# Find the node that is the closest to the WCS
        mn = []
        for m in nodes:
                mn.append(np.linalg.norm(m))
        i_mn = mn.index(min(mn))

```


As a last step the distance between those two nodes (points) will be calculated.


```python
# Calculate the distance
        d = mimics.measure.create_distance_measurement(list(nodes[i_mx]),list(nodes[i_mn]))
else:
        print("The part LV could not be found.")

```


---

# 9. Switch between Mimics and 3-matic


Many workflows require the use of multiple tools from Mimics and 3-matic. With scripting is possible to automate such workflows and use tools from both software packages. This tutorial shows how to continue the workflow in 3-matic while working in Mimics. The results of 3-matic are returned to Mimics and the script continues in Mimics. You can have the scripts of 3-matic and Mimics in different *.py files or in the same file. For this tutorial a single-file script approach is selected. The Mimics project Heart.mcs from `C:\MedData\DemoFiles` is used. 3-matic is used for some advanced operations that are not available in Mimics, consequently there is no 3-matic project loaded.


Since there is only one script used that contains both Mimics and 3-matic part, as a first step we need to check in which software the script runs:


```python
# One script is used for both Mimics and 3-matic.
# For that reason we have to check if we are in Mimics or in 3-matic
try:
    import trimatic
except:
    in_3matic = False
else:
    in_3matic = True
SHARED_OBJ = "Union"

```


Next, the Mimics part is presented. The selected Mimics project is opened and the masks of interest (LA, LV and Aorta) are located.


```python
#If True we are in Mimics
if not in_3matic:
    # import required modules
    import os
    import subprocess
    # Open Heart.mcs Mimics project
    path = r"C:\MedData\DemoFiles\Heart.mcs"
    mimics.file.open_project(path)
    # Find the masks of interest
    masks_names = ["LA","LV", "Aorta"]
    masks = []
    for m in masks_names:
        mask = mimics.data.masks.find(m)
        if mask:
            print("Mask "+ m +" is present.")
            masks.append(mask)

```


In the next step the masks are united to one, using boolean operations, and the Part of the union is created. The Part is exported as STL in the directory where the *.py file of the script is located (use of the special purpose attribute __file__). Furthermore a *.txt file is created where basic log functionality is kept. This *.txt file is also used to transfer required information between Mimics and 3-matic.


```python
# Unite masks
if len(masks) == 3:
    un1 = mimics.segment.boolean_operations(masks[0],masks[1],"Unite")
    union = mimics.segment.boolean_operations(un1,masks[2],"Unite")
    union.name  = SHARED_OBJ
    # Create the Part of the Union mask
    union_part = mimics.segment.calculate_part(union)
    union_part.name = SHARED_OBJ
    #Export the Union Part in the location of the script
    root_path_of_script = os.path.split(os.path.abspath(__file__))[0]
    path_of_stl = os.path.join(root_path_of_script,union_part.name + ".stl")
    mimics.file.export_part(union_part,path_of_stl)
    with open(os.path.join(os.path.split(__file__)[0],"my_temp.txt"),"w") as f:
        f.write(path_of_stl)
        f.write("File is created!\n")

```


As it is mentioned in the introduction of this tutorial, 3-matic is launched from the Mimics part of the script. To achieve this, a built-in Python module called subprocess is used. This module is used in general to activate new processes, connect to their input, output and error pipes and obtain their return codes. In this tutorial the Popen constructor of the subprocess module is used. Please note that this is not the only way to perform the following step. After 3-matic is launched, the script that runs in Mimics will wait until the activated subprocess of 3-matic returns it’s result code.


```python
#Prepare to run 3-matic
trimatic = mimics.file.get_path_to_3matic()
command = trimatic
args = ("-run_script", __file__, path_of_stl,f.name)
process = subprocess.Popen((command,) + args, shell=False, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
process.wait()

```


When the child 3-matic subprocess ends, then the Mimics script will continue. The script reads from the *.txt file the paths of two STL files that are exported from 3-matic (see below for the scripting part of 3-matic) and it loads them to Mimics. Additionally the *.txt file that is used for information transfer purposes, is deleted.


```python
    with open(f.name,"r")as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
    os.remove(f.name)
    for i in range(2):
        mimics.file.import_stl(lines[i+1].strip())
else:
    print("Please check if a mask is missing! Three masks are required.")

```


This it the end of the Mimics part of the script. The 3-matic part follows. The first step is to read the arguments that are passed from Mimics to 3-matic through the subprocess. The arguments are the path of the exported STL file (Union.stl) and the full path of the *.txt file. Next, a plane is fitted to the imported part (Union) and it is used to cut the part. As a result, two parts are created that are exported in the directory of the *.py file. The full path of the exported parts is written in the *.txt file. Those paths are read from Mimics to import the STLs in Mimics as it is explained above.


```python
#If True we are in 3-matic
else:
    import sys
    path_of_stl = sys.argv[1]
    f = sys.argv[2]
    trimatic.import_part_stl(path_of_stl)
    part = trimatic.find_parts(SHARED_OBJ)
    if part:
        plane = trimatic.create_plane_fit(part[0])
        cut_parts = trimatic.cut(part[0],plane)
        exp = trimatic.export_stl_ascii(cut_parts,os.path.split(os.path.abspath(__file__))[0])
        with open(f,"a") as f:
            f.write(exp[0]+"\n")
            f.write(exp[1])
        print("To continue please close 3-matic!")

```


Please note that you have to close 3-matic after it finishes the operations to terminate the subprocess and continue.

# 10. Working with Metadata


Many workflows require the use of multiple tools from Mimics and 3-matic and the transfer of data between both products. With scripting it is possible to automate such workflows and use tools from both software packages. This tutorial shows how to continue the workflow in 3-matic while working in Mimics. Emphasis is put to the metadata that are attached to objects in Mimics and they are kept in 3-matic. More metadata are added in 3-matic. For this tutorial a single-file script approach is selected. The Mimics project Heart.mcs from `C:\MedData\DemoFiles` is used. An empty 3-matic project is used and the Mimics project is imported.


As a first step the required Python libraries are imported and the metadata templates that will be used in Mimics and 3-matic are defined. The template of Mimics contains information about the patient and the study and additionally a field for notes. The template of 3-matic is used to keep record of the processing of the parts. The templates are filled in with information from a non existing patient used for this tutorial.


```python
# import required modules
from collections import OrderedDict as od
import os
import sys
import subprocess
TEMPLATE = od([
            ("Patient" , ""),
            ("Study" , ""),
            ("Notes","")
            ])
TEMPLATE_3_MATIC = od([
            ("Processed" , "False")
            ])
################################
PATIENT_A = od([
            ("Patient" , "Mat patient"),
            ("Study" , "CT Heart scan"),
            ("Notes","")
            ])
################################
MIMICS_FILE_PATH = r"C:\MedData\DemoFiles"
MIMICS_FILE_NAME = "Heart.mcs"
PARTS_OF_INTEREST = ["LA", "LV", "Aorta"]
################################

```


Since there is a single script approach used that contains both Mimics and 3-matic part, as a first step we need to check in which software the script runs:


```python
# One script is used for this tutorial for both Mimics and 3-matic.
# For that reason we have to check if we are in Mimics or in 3-matic
in_mimics = False
try:
    import mimics
    if mimics.get_version():
        in_mimics = True
except:
    pass

```


Next, the Mimics part is presented. The selected Mimics project is opened and all the potentially existing metadata linked to part will be deleted. In this tutorial we are interested in the parts LA, LV and Aorta that exist in the loaded Mimics project. Those parts are grouped in a list so they can be easily used later.


```python
if in_mimics:
    parts = []
    # Open Mimics project
    mimics.file.open_project(os.path.join(MIMICS_FILE_PATH, MIMICS_FILE_NAME))
    # For this exercise we will remove all the metadata from the Mimics project
    for p in mimics.data.parts:
        for md in p.metadata:
            p.metadata.delete(md.name)
    # Group the required parts
    mdp = mimics.data.parts
    for p in PARTS_OF_INTEREST:
        parts.append(mdp[p])

```


In the next step the template of the metadata that is defined in the beginning of this script is attached to all the parts that are listed above. Additionally the template is filled with  patient information that is provided in the beginning of the script.


```python
# Assign the template as metadata to all the parts of interest
l = list(TEMPLATE.items())
for p in parts:
    for i in range(len(TEMPLATE)):
        p.metadata.create(l[i][0],l[i][1])
# Fill the metadata template
patient_a = list(PATIENT_A.items())
for p in parts:
    for i in range(len(PATIENT_A)):
        p.metadata[l[i][0]].value = patient_a[i][1]

```


Slightly before switching to 3-matic the Mimics project is saved. As it is mentioned in the introduction of this tutorial, 3-matic is launched from the Mimics part of the script. To achieve this, a built-in Python module called subprocess is used. This module is used in general to activate new processes, connect to their input, output and error pipes and obtain their return codes. In this tutorial the Popen constructor of the subprocess module is used.


```python
# Save Mimics project
mimics.file.save_project()
#Prepare to run 3-matic
trimatic = mimics.file.get_path_to_3matic()
command = trimatic
args = ("-run_script", __file__)
process = subprocess.Popen((command,) + args, shell=False, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)

```


This it the end of the Mimics part of the script. The 3-matic part follows. The first step is to import the Mimics project. Similar to what happened to Mimics, the parts of interest are grouped for further use.


```python
else:
    parts = []

    trimatic.import_project(os.path.join(MIMICS_FILE_PATH, MIMICS_FILE_NAME))
    # Group the required parts
    tp = trimatic.get_parts()
    for p in tp:
        if p.name in PARTS_OF_INTEREST:
            parts.append(p)

```


As a next step, the metadata template that will be used in 3-matic will be attached to the Parts imported in 3-matic. After that, all the parts will be smoothed. The metadata will be preserved during the smoothing operation.


```python
# Assign the template as metadata elements to all the parts of interest
l3m = list(TEMPLATE_3_MATIC.items())
for p in parts:
    for i in range(len(TEMPLATE_3_MATIC)):
        mdata = p.get_metadata()
        mdata.create(l3m[i][0],l3m[i][1])
# Smooth all the imported parts
trimatic.smooth(entities = parts)

```


As a last step the metadata of the Parts in 3-matic will be updated. More specifically the section Notes that was added via the Mimics template and the section Processed that was added in 3-matic will be filled.


```python
# Add the info that the parts are smoothed and processed
l = list(TEMPLATE.items())
for p in parts:
    mdata = p.get_metadata()
    notes = mdata.find(l[2][0],l[2][1])
    if notes:
        notes.value = "Part is smoothed with default values"
    processed = mdata.find(l3m[0][0],l3m[0][1])
    if processed:
        processed.value = "True"

```

# 11. 4D heart cineloop in parts


The heart is a moving tissue and often one image set is produced for each phase of the cardiac cycle. To visualise the motion of the heart in the 2D slices you can use the Cineloop tool of Mimics. You can access it via View menu -> Cineloop.


This script will help you to create the cineloop for the Parts that correspond to the segmentated anatomy of the different phases of the cardiac cycle.


Before you start the script you need to segment the phases of the cardiac cycle and create parts out of the masks. Make sure that you name the parts that represent the same anatomy with the same name. For example the part that represents the Aorta in all the phases should have the same name everywhere in order to be taken into account from the script. In case you want to run the script immediately after the segmentation (only the masks are present) set the CALCULATE_PARTS_FROM_MASKS variable to True. This action will create automatically the Parts from the Masks and will link them in the respective image sets. Additionally, correct names and colors will be set. After you get the Parts calculated, save the project and set the CALCULATE_PARTS_FROM_MASKS to False. Afterwards you can create the video again from different viewing angles of your choice without calculating again the Parts from the Masks.


The output of this script is a video that shows the motion of the heart accross the cardiac cycle in a specific angle of your choice.


**Before you run the script:**


- Segment the image sets that you want to be visualised the 4D Parts Cineloop.
- Make sure that you have installed the required packages to run this script. To create the video a special Python package, Open CV, is required. You can find more information about the package in the following link:
[https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)


For instructions on how to install a Python package, please refer to Section 2.3 of the Introduction of this guide.


- Check the configuration part of the script below and modify if needed the parameters:


```python
# Here is the configuration area of the script.
# List the names of the anatomy of the Left Heart that you want to visualise in the video.
# In the provided script it is assumed that Left Atrium is LA, Left Ventricle is LV and Aorta is Aorta
LEFT_HEART = ["LA", "LV", "Aorta"]
# List the names of the anatomy of the Right Heart that you want to visualise in the video.
# In the provided script it is assumed that Right Atrium is RA, Right Ventricle is RV and Pulmonary Artery is PA
RIGHT_HEART = ["RA", "RV", "PA"]
# Here you select with part of the heart to visualise in the video.
HEART = LEFT_HEART + RIGHT_HEART
# The name (prefix) of the folder where the screenshots and the video will be saved. The suffix of the folder is the
# name of the Mimics file from where you run the script.
TARGET_FOLDER_NAME = "Output"
# Name of the file of the output video
VIDEO_NAME = "Cineloop_in_parts"
#Frames per second of the video. You can change this value to make the heart beating faster or slower.
FRAMES = 12
# If you want to visualise a logo in your video, the logo should be placed in the same folder as the script.
# If you do not want a logo to be visualised, just leave the script empty. Example: LOGO = ""
LOGO = "mat_logo.jpg"
# To calculate first the 3D Parts from the segmentation masks, set the value of the variable below to True.
# In case you have the Parts already calculated, you can leave it to False
CALCULATE_PARTS_FROM_MASKS = False

```


- Last action before running the script is to set up your 3D view since it is the view of the interest for this script. Visualise the parts that belong to one cardiac phase and position them in the 3D view in the way that you want to be visualised in the video. Mimics will apply the same visualisation position to all the parts that belong to different phases. You do not need to make visible a specific combination of parts before you run the script.
- As a last step you need to run the script and get the results. To run the script click on the Script menu -> Run Script. Select the file in your local directory and confirm your selection.


**Output of the script:**


The output of the scripts is:


- A folder where all the created files are stored. This folder is created in the same level as the script and it is named Output.
- The Output folder contains screenshots of the parts tht are visualised for each cardiac phase. Those screenshots are used to create the video.
- A log file where you can see details about which cardiac phases and which part are visualised in the video. This file is also stored in the level of the script.
